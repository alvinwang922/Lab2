          <h3>Day 1 (Saturday, 04/02/21)</h3>
          <p>On <b>day 1</b>, I did this.</p>
          <p>Things I did today include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Eat</li>

          <p>
            One thing I wish I did today was watch
            <span class="name" style="color:green">Shrek</span>. If you have
            never heard of <span class="name" style="color:green">Shrek</span>,
            here is information and a video of
            <span class="name" style="color:green">Shrek</span>:

              According to Wikipedia, Shrek is a fictional ogre character
              created by American author William Steig. Shrek is the protagonist
              of the book of the same name, a series of films by DreamWorks
              Animation, as well as a musical.

            In all seriousness, though, I did not do too much today. I had
            breakfast with my ACM tree, which I have attached a picture of
            below. I also had a couple meetings, specifically:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>ACM AI Event Lead Standup</li>
            <li>ACM External Standup</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Image of my tree:</h3>

          <h3>Day 2 (Sunday, 04/03/21)</h3>
          <p>
            On day 2, I visited the beach and tide pools in La Jolla. The view
            and the weather were super nice, so this was definitely the
            highlight of my day. I loved that it didn't rain because the sound
            of rain lowkey stresses me out. For example, this sound would stress
            me out.

          <br />
          <p>Here is an image I took at the tide pools:</p>
          <img

            alt="Tide Pool"
            style="width:800px;height:500px;"
          />
          <p>
            In addition, a couple of friends and I formed a team for
            <i>Clash</i>. We were entered into a bracket of 8, hoping to win
            first place, but we were eliminated in the first match, so we
            forfeited and accepted 8th place. This was definitely a lowlight of
            the day.

          <h3>Day 3 (Monday, 04/04/21)</h3>
          <p>
            On day 3, I pretty much did <i>nothing</i>. Why, you may ask? It's
            because I had <strong>0 lectures</strong> and
            <strong> 0 discussions </strong>today. <br />However, the highlight
            of the day was hanging out with friends from an organization at UC
            San Diego called <em>ACM AI</em>, which is an organization that
            emphasizes <em>artificial intelligence</em> and
            <em>machine learning</em>. Feel free to check learn more about ACM
            AI by visiting the
            <a href="https://ai.acmucsd.com/">ACM AI website</a>!<br /><br />
            Here is a picture we took when we hung out: <br /><br />

            />

          <p>
            The low point of my day today was losing a bunch of games in
            <i>League of Legends</i>. If you are not sure what
            <i>League of Legends</i> is, feel free to check out this video:
